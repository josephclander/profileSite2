# profileSite2
This is my second mock-up of a website that could display my work. 


## Features

I have held my current site for some time now and the content has now began to be significant enough to look at how I could further develop my site from what I have studied so far. I started from scratch again. Here are a list of the fetures that I considered when creating this mock-up for a potential new site:

* Continue to use Sass but to improve the folder structure with use of partials
* Create a landing page
* Try different styling techniques for the layout of the articles, such as positioning of article images
* Use CSS Grid and Flexbox
* Create code for a scroll down header with links

## Reflection

I played with the design for sometime and feel that I have gained more experience of how to best use CSS Grid and Flexbox. Through practice and exposure to other websites, I am getting more ideas on how to design better looking, UX focused design features. If I were to continue to work on this site, I would begin to consider a new layout for showing articles. Again, this site has all of them on a single scrolling page. As I write more content, I look at showing only a few articles on the homepage or a grid layout of more recent articles. However, I will leave this as a design until I gain more experience and ideas in how I would like to display my profile site moving forward.
